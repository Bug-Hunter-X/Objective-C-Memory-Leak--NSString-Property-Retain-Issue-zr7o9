In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` mechanisms.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
myObject.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: "Hello"];
[myObject release]; //Potential memory leak here!
```

The issue is that `myString` is retained by `myObject`, but when `myObject` is released, `myString` still has a retain count of 1 (due to the `[[NSString alloc] initWithString]` call), preventing it from being deallocated.  This leads to a memory leak.  The solution usually involves using `autorelease` instead of allocating with `alloc` and `init`.
